$\vec{F}_s$ is the surface contact force. If a system if exerting a perpendicular force onto the surface, the compression of molecules push up which is the surface contact force.  

[[Friction]] is away from the side from the force exerted but not always.

### Magnitude
Friction and normal force is proportional.
