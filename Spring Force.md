# Hooke's Law
If a spring has negligible mass, it will be at it's relaxed length. When relax, zero force is exerted. When a spring is stretch longer than it's relaxed length, $L_0$, then the spring exerts a force on the object called $\vec{F_1}$. The magnitude of the force, $|\vec{F_1}|$ is proportional to $|L-L_0|$. 

$$ S = L-L_0$$
$$|\vec{F_1}| = k_s|L-L_0|$$ $k_s$ is the spring constant.

*This is a spring*

### Formula
$\vec{F} = -k_ss\hat{L}$ 
Magnitude of the Force (Hooke's Law): $|\vec{F}| = k_s|s|$

**Question:**
A spring whose stiffness is 30 $N/m$ is 12 cm long when relaxed.  When the spring is compressed, it's new length is now 10 cm. What is the vector $\vec{L}$? 

Answer: The vector is <0, 10, 0> cm pointing towards the y direction within the picture.
