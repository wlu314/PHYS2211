$$\frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\vec{F_{net}}}{m}$$

The total force ($\vec{F_{net}})$ is the only thing that matter when examining a bunch of forces. Newton's Second Law states that the acceleration of an object is dependent on the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object. 
$$\vec{F_{net}} = m \cdot a$$
$$\vec{F_{net}} = \frac{\vec{\Delta p_{system}}}{\Delta t}$$
The unit for 1 Newton is equal to $kg \cdot m/s^2$.[p]o0

**Building Intuition**
- if a particle travels in a straight line at constant speed, the momentum is constant
- if it's speeding up in a straight line, the momentum is increasing, the net force is acting in the same direction as momentum 
- if a particle is slowing down in a straight line, the momentum is decreasing, the net force is acting in the opposite direction of the momentum
- if the particle travels along a curving path it's momentum changes direction, and a force not parallel to the object's momentum is acting on it
## Using Newton's Second Law
Dissecting the second law, you can calculate the initial or final velocity by breaking down the equation. 
$$\vec{v_f} = (\frac{\vec{F_{net}}}{m})\Delta t + \vec{v_i}$$
