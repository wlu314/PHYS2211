A projectile with mass 6 kg is fired form a catapult at an enemy's castle. The position of the projectile's location is recorded at six different times. All distances have been measured in meters.
1.  <46, 154, 0> m at time = 1s
2. <87, 162, 0> m at time = 2s
3. <169, 118, 0> m at time = 4s
4. <251, -6, 0> m at time = 6s
5. <333, -210, 0> m at time = 8s
6. <374, -342, 0> m at time = 9s

<u>Average Velocity at Positions 1, 2, 3</u>
The velocity is the $\frac{Displacement}{Time}$
1) $<87-46, 162-154, 0>m$ divided by 1s is still the $<41, 8, 0> \frac{m}{s}$
2) $\frac{<169-87, 118-162, 0>} {2-0} = <41, -22, 0>$
3) $\frac{<251-169, -6-118, 0>} {4-2} = <41, -124/2, 0>$
<u>The Average force on  the projectile from position 1 to 3</u>
$\vec{F}=m\cdot\vec{a}$
$\vec{F}=m\cdot\frac{\Delta\vec{v_x}}{\Delta t}$

*x component*
$\vec{F_x} = 6kg\cdot\frac{0}{4-1}$
$\vec{F_x} = 0$

*y component*
$\vec{F_y} = 6kg\cdot\frac{-62-8}{4-1}$
$\vec{F_y} =-140$

A small dense ball with mass 0.8 kg is thrown with initial velocity <2,7,0> m/s at time t=0 from a location we choose to call the origin. Air resistance is negligible.
1. When the ball reaches its maximum height, what is it's velocity
	1. When the ball reaches max height, the y component is zero however the x component remains the same. <2,0,0>
2. When the ball reaches its maximum height, what is t?
	1. $t=\frac{u_y}{g}$
	2. $t=\frac{7}{9.8}$
3. At a time later the ball's height y has returned to zero which menas that arithmetic average value of $v_y$ from t = 0 to this time i zero. At this instant, what is the time t.
	1. At the maximum is the half way point thus. the time is $14/9.8$
4. What is the range of the trajectory?
	1. $2\frac{m}{s}\cdot\frac{14}{9.8}s=\frac{28}{9.8}m$

A golf ball is hit off the ground with an initial velocity $v_0$ at an angle of $\theta$ with respect to the x-axis. In the following questions can safely ignore air resistance. 
1) Find an expression for how high in the air the golf ball will travel
	1) y component: $v_0 sin(\theta)$
	2) In the vertical direction the gravitational pull is acting downwards. $a_y=-g$ 
	3) The maximum height equation is $v_f^2-v_i^2=2a_y*y$
	4) $v_f = 0, v_i = v_0 sin \theta, a_y=-g, y=h$
	5) $Height = \frac{v_0^2sin^2\theta}{2g}$
	
2) Find an expression for how far the golf ball will travel in horizontal terms
	1) The horizontal distance traveled is the time in the air multiplied by the horizontal component
	2) $distance = v_0cos(\theta)*t$
	3) $v_f = v_i + \vec{a}\cdot t$
	4) $v_f^2=v_i^2 + 2(\vec{a})(d)$
	5) $d = v_0*t + \frac{1}{2}a*t^2$
