## Properties of Scalar
### Sign
If the scalar $b$ is positive then the vector will point in the positive direction for $b \cdot \vec{F}$ and  $\frac{\vec{F}}{b}$ in the original direction. If it's negative or $b < 0$ then it will point in the opposite direction. 
### Dimensions
If scalar, $b$ has dimensions, then the new product or dividend will have different dimensions.

*Example*
	$\frac{\vec{F}}{m}$ 
	$=\frac{mass \cdot length}{time^{2}} \cdot mass =\frac{ length}{time^{2}}$
	This new unit is for acceleration. 

#### Representation of Arrows
When multiplying a vector by a scalar with different units/dimensions it's key to note that the new arrow drawn can vary in the length. The direction should be the same.

**Algebraic Representation**
$\vec{r_1}=(x_1)\hat{i}+(y_1)\hat{j}$
$\vec{r_2}=(x_2)\hat{i}+(y_2)\hat{j}$
$\vec{r}=(x_1+x_2)\hat{i}+(y_1+y_2)\hat{j}$
