Physical Quantity describes one piece of information such as mass. [[Weight]] is the gravitational force on system due to the Earth's pull (gravity).

Vectors are described in two pieces of information: **direction** and **magnitude**. 
	**Vectors** are represented using $\vec{F}$ with an arrow on top.
	**Magnitude** is represents with $|\vec{F}|$ or $F$. Magnitude is the dimension of force.
	**Direction** is represented with as $\hat{F}$. The direction has no units.
	$\vec{F}=|\vec{F}|*\hat{F}$
[[Vectors Arithmetic]] includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Multiplication and division have similar concepts of negative and positive scalar. 

[[Coordinate System]] helps to describe vectors in component form.
