# Intro
The cartesian coordinate system is used to help represent [[Courses/PHYS-2211/Vector]]. This 2D or 3D dimension is used to represent spatial dimension. Not time, mass, etc.

Component is not equal to the magnitude. The component contains the sign alongside the axis.

Component Form Vectors
	$<x,y,z>$ for the 3D spatial dimension.
*Example*
	Force $\vec{F_1} = <0,-2,0> \frac{kg \cdot m}{s^2}$
	The magnitude of an arrow isn't represented by the component, but direction is.

### Dividing Rules
In [[Vectors Arithmetic]], a vector can never be on the denominator. 
	$\frac{\vec{F}}{\vec{a}} = m$ is not valid
However, you can divide by a vector magnitude
