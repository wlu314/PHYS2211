$$\vec{F_d}=|\vec{F_d}|\cdot\hat{F_d}$$
The Drag Force is a [[Courses/PHYS-2211/Vector]]. The drag force is always opposite to the direction of motion. This vector motion quantity is velocity ([[Motion, Velocity, Acceleration]]). The magnitude of velocity and drag force are proportional. 
$$ |\vec{F_d}| = b |\vec{v}|$$The constant $b$ has units of: $\frac{N\cdot s}{m}$. This is not always the same, it depends on Air Flow and the object's properties. No air = no drag force
