**Lagrangian Formula**
____
$$L = T-V$$
*T is the Kinetic Energy, V is the Potential Energy*

**Derive the Kinetic Energy**
____
T is a combination of the rotational kinetic energies of the two arms and the translational kinetic energy of the masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$.
$$T = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 +  \frac{1}{2}m_2v_2^2 $$
