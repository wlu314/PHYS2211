Center of mass is also called translation. 

### One Dimensional Translation
Position represented in meters (m)
Time represented in seconds (sec)

With $x_1t_1$ and $x_2t_2$ being the initial and final position respectively.
	Change in Time: $\Delta t =t_2 -t_1$
	Change in Position: $\Delta x =x_2 -x_1$

## Velocity
Average Velocity 
	$\bar{v} = \frac{x_2 -x_1}{t_2 -t_1}$
	unit are represented as $\frac{meters}{second}$
The length of $\Delta x$ arrow means length. The length of $\bar{v}$ arrow does not mean length. $\bar{v}$ is a vector. $\Delta x$ is a vector. $\Delta t$ is a positive scalar. It's the displacement divided by time.

### Speed vs. Velocity
Total Distance Travel divided by the time

## Acceleration
Change in average velocity. If two average velocity vectors are in the opposite direction it means the object is slowing down.
